## Why build a personal site?

I've had the terminal simulator version of this site running for a while. It was fun to build and people seemed to enjoy it. But I wanted somewhere to write things down - not for anyone in particular, just to organize my own thinking.

Most of what I know about software I learned by building things. Same with business. Writing is just another way to build — you take scattered ideas and turn them into something concrete.

So here we are. I'll write when I have something worth saying. No schedule, no pressure. Just notes from someone who's figuring things out as he goes.

If you want to talk about anything I write, send me an email: nkosinski@ordinconsulting.com
