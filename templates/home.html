        <p class="tagline">Managing Director, Odoo US</p>
        <p class="intro">
            I run U.S. operations for Odoo out of Buffalo, NY. I focus on building high-performing teams, growing revenue, and creating systems that scale. I stay close to the technical side because I believe leaders should understand how things are built. I value simplicity, execution, and learning by doing.
