                    <li>Selected Buffalo as the U.S. expansion hub after being tasked by the CEO to optimize cost and scalability &mdash; a choice he now publicly cites as one of Odoo's most successful strategic moves (27% OPEX reduction).</li>
                    <li>Built the full organizational structure and scaled the subsidiary from 0 to 425+ employees across all functions (sales, consulting, engineering, HR, marketing, support, administration) while maintaining profitability from day one.</li>

                    <li>Grew Odoo's East Coast operation to $38M in annual revenue and $21.3M in ARR (Nov 2025), making it one of the company's fastest-scaling regions.</li>

                    <li>Reduced OPEX through NYS incentives, including 100% sales-tax exemption on equipment and 0% state income tax for all Buffalo employees, strengthening recruiting and retention at no added cost.</li>
